This is the official Uncanny game project made with the Unity game engine. 
You are free to look at the code if you are curious on how my first real game was made!
the game is based on a bullet hell engine I conceived with Unity. Although it works great in the game, unfortunately, it is not usable. 
Feel free to give feedbacks.

## Description

Uncanny is an action rhythm game where the player must survive by dodging and dashing through uncanny boss attacks.

Get ready to savor the ultimate indie flavor, a delectable sauce featuring gameplay inspired by Just Shapes & Beats and an uncanny Cuphead-esque atmosphere.

The game is set in a funny and uncanny atmosphere, where the player can play with the music. As the game progresses, the monsters become more challenging to dodge, and the player must use quick reflexes and timing to survive.

The game is very short with two main levels, each featuring a special uncanny boss. 

Created entirely by one developer, Uncanny features original music, animation and art, making it a passion project fueled by inspiration. 

It is only the beginning...
