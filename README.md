# Bullet Hell Official Game Project
Project of the Bullet Hell game I'm making thanks to my Unity-Based Bullet hell Engine.

The Bullet Hell Engine will be finalized in this project after finishing a functional video game.

It is not yet usable since there is a specific way of implementing the project. There is not yet something concrete to show as a unique game to see if it works as it should in a game.

Project based on teh new Input Actions System by Unity Technologies.
